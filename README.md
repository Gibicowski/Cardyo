# Cardyo
An app for learning vocabulary

Have you ever had so many difficulties while playing basketball or maybe boxing? maybe it is because you haven't taken your cardio seriously. I think, there are some resemblances
between body exercises and language learning. Because in various forms of sports, the foundation is always cardio exercises. This also applies in language learning in the 
perspective of vocabulary learning. Vocabulary learning is the cardio for your language learning journey, and it should be taken seriously. That is why, I came up with a useful
app that contributes to your language learning, which is called CARDYO.

With CARDYO, you can learn from a list that includes a wide variety of words! Here is how you can use it:


Firstly, you should learn your words before testing yourself. That is why you are heading to "Learn". In here, there you can see a card, which you can flip. In one side,
there is the word and in the other side there is the meaning. Whenever you feel comfortable, you can move to the next card by tapping the "Next card" button.

If you want to go back to the previous card, you can always tap the "Previous card" button.

When you feel confident in yourself, you can tap the "Main menu" button or the back button for Android.

Let' start then! In here, you also see a card with bunch of other buttons and things. This time, you are able to see the definition but not the word itself. Because, I expect
you to guess the word and type it in the input box in the middle. After typing your guess you can either press the enter button on your keyboard or you can tap the "check!" button.

Afterwards, If you guess the word correctly, you will hear a "bleep" sound, you will see a small green informative box on the upper screen and you will be able to see the word
when you scroll it!

If you guess it wrong, you will hear a "dzzt" sound along with a red informative box in the upper screen. But don't worry! Because nobody is going to punish you for that.
You can try as many times as you want.

Struggling with remembering the word? Maybe you are not familiar with the exact spelling? No worries! You can always skip this word and move to the next one. Maybe if you 
remember it afterwards, you can always come back!
